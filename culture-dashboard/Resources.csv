In 2006, one of the underpasseswas deemed unfit for purpose but the mosaics were of suchsignificance it was decided that four portions of the mosaic would be lifted, removed and redisplayed in the new Ikea carpark (see below for details of the new location).The designs of both walls of the underpass were glass mosaicin modular form. It was not until they were redisplayed that their most significant feature became obvious; once enoughdistance could be placed between the viewer and the mosaic(and this was impossible in an underpass) it became clear that the design had that outstanding quality of the 1960smovement known as Op-Art"

Arthur Ling was much influenced byGordon Cullen's ideas on pedestrianisation and zonal spaces.The mural depicts silk weaving, clock and watch making, bicycles and motor cars as well as the broader history ofarchitecture in the City. Sadly, the medieval maps and tracerysection were lost in the 1970s due to careless workmanship. The tiles were made by Carter's of Poole and are a mix ofmodern screen- printed designs and superbly intricate tubelining tile decoration to depict the various elements in themural.

The Lady GodivaClock is part of the first phase of development followingthe wartime devastation of the city centre. The first CityArchitect and Planning Officer for Coventry, DonaldGibson, was appointed, aged just 29, in 1938 and it was hismasterplan that formed the basis for that planned post-warredevelopment of Coventry. Gibson commissioned the sculptor, Trevor Tennant to designthe clock. The backdrop to the Lady Godiva feature is madeup of ceramic tiles by Carters of Poole. On the hour, LadyGodiva appears riding below the Peeping Tom of legend. Interestingly, in the earliest versions Peeping Tom does notfeature as Lady Godiva rides through the city in protest, soit is said, against her husband, Leofric's excessive taxes on the people. She rides 'naked of raiment', which could meanthat she was seen without her wealthy finery but wearing asimple shift. However, legend soon had it that she rode naked and the citizens, out of respect for her, stayed indoors exceptfor one 'Peeping Tom', who later had his eyes burned out aspunishment. Trevor Tennant (1900-1980) trained at Goldsmith's Collegeof Art and at the Royal Academy. He exhibited twice atthe Royal Academy and was a member of the Artists International Association. He also collaborated closely withDorothy Annan (1900-1983), ceramic muralist and painter.Her murals were mainly for public commissions, including a Listed work now conserved and on display at the BarbicanCentre, London."

Hoskins visited Geneva to find inspiration for hisdesigns in mosaic.The mosaic depicts eleven Coventry martyrs burned at thestake in the first half of the 16th century at or near LittlePark Street. The eleven were all Lollards, a religious groupwho were strongly represented in the dyers and textileindustries of the Midlands. The Lollards were followers of John Wycliffe who had translated the Bible into vernacularEnglish in the 14th century.

Visitors are advised to check times of opening prior to theirvisit.Medieval floor tiles are found in the west Oriel windowof the Great Hall; these could be in their original location. Upstairs, in the Treasury there is a pavement made offragments which may have also come from the Great Hall.These pavement fragments are likely to have been movedhere as part of the 1946 rebuilding of the tower after the wartime Blitz.Archaeological evidence of kilns suggests a significantlocal tile making industry in the area. One such kiln site inthe environs of the city was discovered in 1911 at Stoke and another, in 1940, a short distance away in Clay Lane.The name of the street is a strong indicator too, for kilnswere often built close to a source of suitable material.Archaeological evidence confirms that commercial tileries were in operation at Coventry for some 150 to 200 years.Tile-makers from Coventry were allowed to form a Guild,suggesting that manufacture here was unusually important. However, we cannot be certain that the tiles found in theGuildhall are from Stoke. The Treasury pavement containsfragments of tiles, some heraldic and some with Latin forms, which are the same design as tiles made at Chilvers Coton,just south of Nuneaton. Medieval tilers were known to travelfrom place to place taking their moulds and designs withthem. What we do know is that both Chilvers Coton and thetile making centres local to Coventry share many of the samedesigns.The Arms of Berkeley are situated in the Oriel window of the Great Hall. In this same floor two tiles are decoratedwith the capital letter 'R', which perhaps makes a connectionwith Richard de Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick (1382- 1439) whose mother was Margaret Ferrers, and his first wife,Elizabeth de Berkeley. If this is a reliable attribution, this wouldprobably place the dating of the tiles somewhere betweenhis succession as earl in 1401, and his remarriage followingElizabeth's death in 1422.The Guildhall also contains two other interesting tile features, a small fireplace in the Princes Chamber decorated withwhat are likely to be English Delft tiles, probably made inLondon circa 1730 to 1750. Notice the cute little angel motif in the corner of some tiles. There is also a much larger, stoneand plaster fireplace in the Mayoress Parlour dating from therestoration of 1834-35 and decorated with early Minton tiles."

Formerly the Gaumont Picture Palace and later the OdeonCinema. The architect was Percy Bartlett, chief assistant toWilliam Henry Watkins of Bristol. The impressive white,modernist, glazed terracotta faience has colourful, yptianate pilaster capitals and a green frame to the central window.The most likely manufacturer for this facade is Hathern ofLeicester. Ex-Coliseum Dance Hall and Cafe (1921-3). Nextdoor to the Ellen Terry Building we can see this former dance hall, a bold Edwardian, baroque style building in whitefaience topped with balustrade and dome. Not much isknown about this uilding, other than that it was part of theGaumont in 1928. The architect is thought to be J. H. Gilbert."

Visitors are advised to check times of opening prior totheir visit. The excavation of the 13th century refectory of St. Mary'spriory, the first of Coventry's three cathedrals, revealedan extraordinary well- preserved set of encaustic floortiles. The layout is intact with a recognisable group of over thirty tiles. They appear to be fourteenth century and weremanufactured locally at Stoke, Cventry. The date is arrivedat by the depiction on one tile of the armorial arms of SirThomas Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, 1360. Numerous othertiles were also excavated from around the site of the prioryall of which were typical of the period."
Coventry Cathedral,Coventry Cathedral,CV1 2GN,Coventry Wayfinding Map - Tile Trail,Coventry Wayfinding Map - Tile Trail,,Coventry Wayfinding Map,52.4085787,-1.5070997,"We end our trail at the truly awe-inspiring connectionbetween the old Coventry and the new. Designed by SirBasil Spence, the Cathedral was ten years from conceptionto completion. It has, from its beginning, been a symbol of peace and reconciliation after the inhuman evils of the warsof the 20th century. The first ever city 'twinning' was betweenCoventry and Stalingrad (now Volgograd) in 1944. Other twinnings followed and the links between Coventry and thewartime bombed city of Dresden in Germany have remainedstrong to this day. In the time between 1962 and today the sandstone exterior of the cathedral has weathered to matchthe ancient stonework of the old building.Leading from the North Aisle is the Chapel of Unity with itselaborate marble mosaic floor by Einar Forseth of Sweden (1892-1988). This floor can be considered as a modern takeon the 13th Century Cosmati pavement in WestminsterAbbey recalling the wide variety of coloured marbles and abstract designs. The floor is dished in the centre so thatround objects will roll to the centre to symbolise peaceand unity between peoples. Mosaicist Trata Maria Drescha completed the cutting and laying of the marble pieces over aperiod of six months. From the baptistry down the South Aisle is the Chapel ofGethsemane decorated with a beautiful mosaic, The Angel ofAgony, by Steven Sykes. It is designed to be viewed through a wrought iron Crown of Thorns which was designed bySpence.Steven Sykes (1914  1999) was active in the British desert camouflage unit during WW11 and was responsible for thelarge-scale military deception in the defence of Tobruk in1942. He was described as an excellent camouflage officer technically, and one who thinks about camouflage in termsof battle. One can imagine that following his war timeexperiences the commission to work in Coventry Cathedral would have been especially poignant."
