    <h1>Geographies</h1>
    <p>Welcome to <strong>geographies.csv</strong>. This is a file containing all the possible combination of statistical, administrative, health and bespoke geographies that we can think of, including postcodes, GP practices, NHS trusts, census output areas, lower layer super output areas (LSOAs), middle layer super output areas (MSOAs), electoral wards, family hubs, clinical commissioning group (CCG) primary care networks (PCNs), combined authorities, regions, and countries). Where possible, the geographies are mapped to each other so that users can choose any geography, such as a postcode, and see how it fits into any other geography, e.g. a family hub area or a primary care network.  The file is supplied as a comma separated values (csv) file in a consistent location to make it possible for different software applications to all point at the same location.</p>
